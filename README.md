# Zomato Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the Zomato Data Analysis project! This project is a Python-based exploration of restaurant data sourced from Zomato. Using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, this analysis uncovers insights into customer preferences, spending habits, and ordering trends.

Project Overview
This project delves into data provided in two primary datasets:

customer.csv: Provides information on customer demographics and preferences.
orders.csv: Records order details, including items ordered, timestamps, and total spend.
The analysis involves:

Numerical Computations: Using NumPy for efficient numerical operations.
Data Manipulation: Utilizing Pandas for DataFrame operations and data transformations.
Visualizations: Leveraging Matplotlib to create line graphs, pie charts, and bar charts to visualize key trends.

Key Insights
This analysis aims to:

Identify popular items and spending patterns.
Understand customer demographics and preferences.
Track order trends over time.

Technologies Used
NumPy: For array operations and numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation, DataFrame handling, and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating clear and informative visualizations.
